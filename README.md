# makurdiCallibration
An organized collection of all the towns or districts or better still Areas as some will have it called and major streets alongside villages and their zip codes within Makurdi city. The project is for the main time limited to Makurdi city as an honor to the Federal University of Agriculture Makurdi.
It is built with pure HTML5, CSS3 and PHP7 over two color shades; black and white. I currently refer to this work as version 0.1 and hope to continually build on this by and by.
