                <h2>What is your opinion about this work</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the first major project I have carried out in my quest to become a software 
                    developer. It is built with pure HTML5, CSS3 and PHP7 over two color shades; black 
                    and white. I currently refer to this work 
                    as version 0.1 and hope to continually build on this by and by. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    On this note, I 
                    humbly beseek you to make your inputs, critisism, comments and or opinions aimed 
                    at improving this work and most especially my quest to be a developer. In other 
                    to achieve this, the work is hereby hosted. This will 
                    bridge the gape of communication between you and I.
